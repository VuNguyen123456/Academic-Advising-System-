This project is focused on building a system that creates a topological sort for a directed acyclic graph (DAG) while considering preferences or priorities for ordering vertices. The idea is to generate a valid ordering of vertices such that if there's an edge from vertex u to vertex v, u appears before v in the topological order. In addition to standard topological sorting, the system takes into account specific preferences, such as prioritizing one vertex over another when both are valid next steps from a given vertex. For instance, if a user has a choice between two classes after completing another class, one class can be given a higher priority.

The project is divided into three parts. The first part involves creating a min-heap priority queue, which is essential for managing the priorities of the vertices as the topological sort is performed. The second part focuses on the creation of a graph structure that can store the vertices, edges, and their associated priorities. This graph must be able to handle basic graph operations such as adding and removing vertices and edges, and querying the neighbors of a vertex in a sorted manner based on priority. In the third part, the actual topological sort algorithm will be implemented. This algorithm not only follows the basic idea of topological sorting but also ensures that vertices with higher priority are processed earlier, provided there is no dependency that forces a different order.

The project requires a deep understanding of data structures like graphs and heaps, as well as the ability to apply graph traversal algorithms. The use of a priority queue is key to ensuring that the topological sort respects the user-defined preferences, and the implementation must efficiently handle graph operations using techniques such as adjacency lists and maps. Testing and debugging are crucial throughout, especially for the heap and graph classes, as they form the foundation for the topological sorting algorithm. The final system will output a topological ordering of the graph's vertices, considering both the graph's inherent structure and the user-defined priorities.
