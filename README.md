This project involves creating a topological sort for a directed acyclic graph (DAG) while considering vertex priorities. It uses a min-heap priority queue to manage these priorities and implements a graph structure that supports efficient vertex and edge operations. The final system outputs a topological order based on dependencies and priorities.
